## Overview

**Bazar** is place where people can sell miscellaneous and tends to be more informal in nature than a marketplace.

## MVP

One-to-many relationship where a user can sign up for an account and list multiple items for sale. The principal screens will be a gallery view of items for sale of all users, a registration page, a user profile page where his/her items for sale can be created, updated, and deleted.

### Goals

- Build full-stack, full-CRUD app with user authentication utilizing a RESTful JSON API with the so-called "React on Rails" stack.

### Libraries and Dependencies

Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                              |

#### Component Tree

Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

#### Component Architecture

Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like.

```structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```
